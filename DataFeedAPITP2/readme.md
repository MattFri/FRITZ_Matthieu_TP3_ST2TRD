## TP2 DataFeedAPI. 

- The difficulties of the TP2 was the API call and the process. I never did that before so it was a bit difficult. Moreover understanding the respond of the API and the object returned was really tricky. 
- S.O.L.I.D principles : 
  - Single responsibility principle. 
  - Open-closed principle. 
  - Liskov substitution principle. 
  - Interface Segregation principle. 
  - Dependency inversion principle.
- KISS rule is keep it super simple such than an idiot could understand. It means we have to code the simpliest way possible. 
- 5 ways to improve previous TP2 : 
  - Make a GUI ( sorry but some problems with it, not enough time to deal with it)
  - Add comment for complexe function. 
  - UNIT Test
  - Make less redondant function
  - Maybe make UML diagram.
